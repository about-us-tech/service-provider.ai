    <li>Act on behalf of Part A in official negotiations unless explicitly instructed in writing by Part A.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>2.3</strong> At Part A’s discretion, and depending on performance or need, Part B may be invited to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Temporarily act as a nominee holder of shares (name only, no ownership interest)</li>
    <li>Attend business meetings on behalf of Part A</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In all such cases, Part B agrees to act in good faith and in alignment with Part A’s interests and intentions.</p>

  <p class="section-title">3. Assignment & Communication</p>
  <p>Part A will notify Part B at least 1 day in advance when requesting specific support, including task details. No ongoing duties are required unless tasks are assigned.</p>

  <p class="section-title">4. Compensation</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>4.1</strong> Part B will be paid USD $15/hour based on actual time worked.</li>
    <li><strong>4.2</strong> Payment may be settled after each 8 hours accumulated, or as mutually agreed.</li>
    <li><strong>4.3</strong> Alternatively, specific tasks may be compensated at a flat rate between USD $10–$50, depending on complexity.</li>

  <p>This agreement is non-exclusive and non-binding long-term.  
  Part A reserves the right to adjust, end, or replace the temporary representative arrangement at any time, depending on business needs, with no hard commitment expected from either side.</p>

  <p class="section-title">8. Independent Status</p>
